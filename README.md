Questionnaire

Create a series of questions to get to know a person.  Allow the user to enter several items (ex: name, hobbies, favorites) Then create a story using the items the user entered.  Sample run...

```
Enter name: Kim
Enter Subjective Prounoun: she
Enter Objective Prounoun: her

What is your favorite hobby: rock climbing  
```

```
This is Kim, she likes rock climbing and her favorite flavor of ice-cream

Soccer Team Calculator

Create a soccer team calculator.  The program will calculate the number of teams that can be created from the kids that show up for the tryouts.  

The project will look similar to:

```
How many players show up to the tryout: 38
How many players will play on the field: 11
You can make 3 teams each team will have about 12.6 players
```

Domain

Write a program to determine the Domain of the website.  Allow the user to enter the URL of the website.  The program will then report the domain in upper case letters.

The domain is the last three letters, usually in the form of com, net, gov, mil, org, and edu.  We will simplify this program and stick to only testing those particular 3 letter domains.

The project will look similar to:

```
Enter the URL: http://www.google.com
The domain is COM
```

Party Planner

The Treehouse museumLinks to an external site. has a party room to allow guests to celebrate their birthdays.  There are different costs depending on the type of party and if they are a member of the Treehouse.  The costs are shown below.

```

Playtime Party:         | 125          | 160
Deluxe Storybook Party: | 275          | 350
```

Follow along with the videos to write a program to calculate the cost.  Allow the user to choose what type of party they would like and if they are a member.  Then display the cost of the party:

```
Welcome to the Treehouse museum
What type of party Package would you like:
1. Playtime Party
2. Deluxe Storybook Party
Enter Choice: 2
Are you a member of the Treehouse Museum
1. Yes
2. No
