Soccer Team Calculator

Create a soccer team calculator.  The program will calculate the number of teams that can be created from the kids that show up for the tryouts.  

The project will look similar to:

`
How many players show up to the tryout: 38
How many players will play on the field: 11
You can make 3 teams each team will have about 12.6 players
`

Domain

Write a program to determine the Domain of the website.  Allow the user to enter the URL of the website.  The program will then report the domain in upper case letters. 

The domain is the last three letters, usually in the form of com, net, gov, mil, org, and edu.  We will simplify this program and stick to only testing those particular 3 letter domains. 

The project will look similar to:

`
Enter the URL: http://www.google.com
